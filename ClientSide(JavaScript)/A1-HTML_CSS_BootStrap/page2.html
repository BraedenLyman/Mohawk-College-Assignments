				<h2>Jujitsu</h2>
				<p>
					As jujitsu being one of my hobbies, I participate in this hobby by going to a family
					run dojo called Perrins Martial Arts. At Parrins Martial Arts, my sensei Matt is a 
					black belt Jujitsu master. The class is broken down into three parts.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Warm Up
						<ul>
							<li>
								We start by runing around the dojo stretching out our arms and legs.
								As part of the warm up we also do jujitsu warm up moves like: shrimping,
								rolls, leg sweeps, bear crawls, etc.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>Learn new move
						<ul>
							<li>
								During this part of the class, Matt will have someone as the volunteer. 
								He will perform the move on that individual, then get us to work with a 
								partner and do the same.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					
					<li>Sparing
						<ul>
							<li>
								During the last part of the class, we then spar with other individuals in the 
								class of all differnt levels. Sparing consists of trying to sumbmit the other 
								person by choking them out, or getting them to "tap out".
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Sparing</h2>
				<p>
					Whether it's sparing in Jujitsu or sparing
					in kickboxing/MMA. On a monthly basis my friends and I try to get together to spar. We usually
					will fight at 80% or less using the skills we have and trying new skills on eachother. The whole 
					purpose of sparing, is to help eachother grow by being in a "Dummied Down fight" one on one.
					After a nice day of sparing, we go into the sana to sweat some more. After the sana, we go out for 
					a nice dinner and watching the UFC Fights for that night.
