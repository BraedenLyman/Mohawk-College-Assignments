				<p>Author: Frekrik Backman</p>
				<p>Description:</p>
				<p>
					At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots 
					- neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the 
					vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection 
					rounds of the local streets.</p>
				
				<p>
					But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving 
					conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it just so?</p>

				<p>Author: James Clear</p>
				<p>Description:</p>
			
				<p>
					No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading 
					experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones,
					and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.</p>

				<p>	
					If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again
					and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals.
					You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p>

				<p>Author: Stephen King</p>
				<p>Description:</p>
			
				<p>
					A #1 New York Times Bestseller and New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice! Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes into the deepest well of his 
					imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the
					stakes could not be higher—for that world or ours.
	
					Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. 
					But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was seven, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take 
					care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at the top 
					of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds emerge from it.</p>
					
				<p>
					Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape 
					telling a story no one would believe. What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is a portal to another world.</p>
				
				<p>
					King’s storytelling in Fairy Tale soars. This is a magnificent and terrifying tale in which good is pitted against overwhelming evil,
					and a heroic boy—and his dog—must lead the battle.</p>
				
				<p>
					Early in the Pandemic, King asked himself: “What could you write that would make you happy?”</p>

				<p>
					“As if my imagination had been waiting for the question to be asked, I saw a vast deserted city—deserted but alive. 
					I saw the empty streets, the haunted buildings, a gargoyle head lying overturned in the street. I saw smashed statues 
					(of what I didn’t know, but I eventually found out). I saw a huge, sprawling palace with glass towers so high their tips pierced the clouds. 
					Those images released the story I wanted to tell.”</p>

				<p>Author: J.K. Rowling</p>
				<p>Description:</p>
			
				<p>
					Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. 
					Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. 
					Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: 
					Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>

				<p> 
					Having now become classics of our time, the Harry Potter ebooks never fail to bring comfort and escapism to readers of all ages.
					With its message of hope, belonging and the enduring power of truth and love, the story of the Boy Who Lived 
					continues to delight generations of new readers.</p>

				<p>Author: Jane Austen</p>
				<p>Description:</p>

				<p>
					Pride and Prejudice is a comedy of manners centered around the Bennet family, a family of five daughters where the parents are desperate 
					for at least one of them to make a wealthy match and save the next generation from destitution. Austen's story engages with the tension between 
					marrying for love, rather than wealth or social prestige, and the pressure to assure financial security. Originally published in 1813, Pride and Prejudice 
					is one of the best-loved and best-selling novels in English literature of all time.</p>

				<p>
					Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English novelist known for her novels about the British landed gentry and the social, 
					economic, and romantic pressures faced by young women. Her comic wit and use of irony and literary realism have given 
					her novels remarkable staying power, remaining as relevant and meaningful to readers today as during her own time.</p>

				<p>Author: J. Kenji López-Alt</p>
				<p>Description:</p>

				<p>
					J. Kenji López-Alt’s debut cookbook, The Food Lab, revolutionized home cooking, selling more than half a million copies with its science-based approach to 
					everyday foods. And for fast, fresh cooking for his family, there’s one pan López-Alt reaches for more than any other: the wok.</p>

				<p>
					Whether stir-frying, deep frying, steaming, simmering, or braising, the wok is the most versatile pan in the kitchen. Once you master 
					the basics—the mechanics of a stir-fry, and how to get smoky wok hei at home—you’re ready to cook home-style and restaurant-style dishes
					from across Asia and the United States, including Kung Pao Chicken, Pad Thai, and San Francisco–Style Garlic Noodles. López-Alt also breaks 
					down the science behind beloved Beef Chow Fun, fried rice, dumplings, tempura vegetables or seafood, and dashi-simmered dishes.</p>
