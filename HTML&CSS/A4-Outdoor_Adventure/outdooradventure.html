					<p>
						In the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, and United Kingdom, hiking means walking 
						outdoors on a trail, or off trail, for recreational purposes. A day hike refers to a hike that can be 
						completed in a single day. However, in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as 
						rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern England, Including the 
						Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking describes hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common 
						word for both features there.
					</p>

					<p>
						Hiking sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This specifically refers
						to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth, or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing
						vegetation aside. In extreme cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage
						is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking refers to both on and
						off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by New Zealanders are tramping (particularly for overnight
						and longer trips), walking or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day 
						hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America, South America, Iran, and 
						the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance trail from end-to-end is also referred to as 
						trekking and as thru-hiking in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping, 
						are referred to as backpacking.

				<h2 class="h2">Canoeing</h2>
					<p>
						Canoeing is an activity which involves paddling a canoe with a single-bladed paddle. Common meanings 
						of the term are limited to when the canoeing is the central purpose of the activity. Broader meanings 
						include when it is combined with other activities such as canoe camping, or where canoeing is merely a 
						transportation method used to accomplish other activities. Most present-day canoeing is done as or as a 
						part of a sport or recreational activity. In some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and 
						kayaking, with a canoe being called an open canoe.
					</p>
					<p>
						Canoes are widely used for competition and pleasure, such as racing, whitewater, touring and camping, 
						freestyle, and general recreation. Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936. The intended use of 
						the canoe dictates its hull shape and length and construction material. Historically, canoes were dugouts 
						or made of bark on a wood frame, but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to
						aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass.
					</p>
					<p>
						Canoes were developed by cultures all over the world, including some designed for use with sails or 
						outriggers. Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, 
						and in some places it still is used as such, perhaps with the addition of an outboard motor. Where the 
						canoe played a key role in history, such as the northern United States, Canada, and New Zealand, it 
						remains an important theme in popular culture.
